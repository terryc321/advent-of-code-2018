# day20

first task parse input

realised if replace string on |) to ) simplified input
then realised if replace | with blank space 
and put ( ) at beginning and end 
s expression with symbols that just need to be split apart into individual N S E W 

OR  CAN we ?

how difficult is it to write a parser ?
```
N S E W 
   | 
  a b  
```
