tried writing solution in scala

functional programming bit awkward ,
not sure on semantics of assignment

either way

50 x 50 two dimensional grid 

# lumber yard
. open space
| trees

transition rules for each square and 8 surrounding squares

1 2 3
4 X 5
6 7 8

scala version does not tally up with small demo ?
